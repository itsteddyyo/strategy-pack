# Base Config explained

The base config is written as yaml. This should make it easy to make your own changes because it is written exactly as you would in your dashboard.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/itsteddyyo/strategy-pack/blob/main/src/config/{{- include.config -}}.yml){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to change things just overwrite the parts you want to change.

In the end your config and the base config get merged so the strategy has all required configuration options.
