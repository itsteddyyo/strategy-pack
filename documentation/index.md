# Strategy Pack

### *First, what are Strategies?*

A strategy is JavaScript code that gets executed to create Dashboards and Views automatically. They make it easy to have auto-populated Dashboards with next to no configuration!

You no longer need to painstakingly specify and order every entity and card on your Dashboard with thousands of lines of YAML! 

More on them in the [Home Assistant Documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-strategy/){:target="_blank"}.

### *What does Strategy Pack do?*

It provides a multitude of these Strategies! There's even some that create whole Dashboards with all your entities neatly displayed!

But there are also some more specific Strategies if have found a need for in my personal Home Assistant Journey.

And I look forward to adding more. So feel free suggest new ones, or even make your own and submit a Pull Request!

### *Nice-looking Dashboard and all, but what's special about this?*

The clue is that a Strategy auto-generates everything. Meaning you do not need to list all entities and cards you want in some cumbersome way.

You can just let the Strategy work its magic with some few lines of YAML configuration or in some Strategies even no configuration at all!

And if you donâ€™t like what you get in your Dashboard just read the detailed configuration documenation for every Strategy giving you the ability to customize next to everything!

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>The minimal configuration...</th>
      <th>... and the impressive result!</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
views:
  - strategy:
      type: custom:battery-view-strategy
    path: battery
    icon: mdi:battery-50
    title: Battery
        </pre>
      </td>
      <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/battery/battery-view-strategy.png" alt="Battery View Strategy" style="max-height: 20rem;" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### *It looks like it needs a whole lot of space on the screen. Do I need a second Dashboard for my phone?*

The Strategies are all fully responsive, meaning you can use all of them on Tablets and Phones as well! That`s just what i do!

*Example of Responsiveness with Area Dashboard Strategy:*

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/area/area-strategy-responsive-new.gif" alt="Area Strategy Responsive" style="max-height: 20rem;" />
