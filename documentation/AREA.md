# Area Strategy

The Area Strategy is a Dashboard Strategy, meaning it does not only create a single view but multiple views at once.

It generates a Dashboard with one View per Area configured in your Home Assistant. The Dashboard contains all entities assigned to that Area (either via device or entity itself).

 ![Area Strategy](/documentation/area-strategy.gif "Area Strategy")

 You may not be able to tell it generates multiple Views because all but one are made invisible in the top menu (last three are other custom views).

This is because the navigation is meant to be made with the left-sided navigation menu.

## Usage

You need to create a new empty Dashboard for this Strategy Dashboard.

Dashboard -> Edit Dashboard -> Raw Configuration Editor (kebap menu) -> Paste the following

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:area-dashboard-strategy
```

This will create a Dashboard with multiple View for your specific Areas.

If you want to personalize and configure this auto-generated Dashboard, take a look at [the configuration documentation](#configuration).

## Configuration

This Strategy is completely configurable.
Modifications are possible to:

- the left-sided navigation menu (modifications to the area-card)
- the tabs in the main area (number of tabs, their names, icons, etc.)
- the content of the tabs (number of grids, header, cards in the grids, etc.)

[Details here](./CONFIGURATION.md#configuration)

There is a sensible default configuration, which is the one i myself use.
So you can start out without configuring anything and have a nice dashboard.
And if you find something you donâ€™t like, just start configuring!

[Default Configuration explained](./CONFIGURATION.md#default-config-explained)

## UI explained

![UI Explained](/documentation/area-strategy-ui-explained.png "UI Explained")

### 1. Navigation

The Area Cards are forming a navigation menu. You can navigate the Views with a Click on the Area Card on the left Side.

You can see the Areas have a colored overlay.
I hope this helps with navigation at a glance, but honestly i also just like the look.

The currently selected Room will have no overlay to distinguish it from the others.

All the details of the area card, the overlay color and even a blacklist of areas you want to hide [can be configured](./CONFIGURATION.md#configuration-options).

>[!NOTE]
>If you want the area card to show a background image you need to [upload an image to your area.](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/organizing/areas/#creating-an-area)

### 2. Tabs

The Entities/Cards are grouped in different tabs.

They should be used to add another logical layer to dashboard apart from the rows and make the dashboard less cluttered.

Those can be [configured freely](./CONFIGURATION.md#tabs).

### 3. Content/Rows

A Tab can contains as many rows of entities as you like. The rows are supposed to represent different domains and their entities.

For example one row for media_players and another row for switches.

The number of rows, their content, the heading and the cards used to display the entities are also completly [configurable](./CONFIGURATION.md#contentrows)

### 4. Top

The area above the navigation is completly configurable with a slot (of sorts) ["topCards"](./CONFIGURATION.md#topCards).

That means nothing is displayed there in the default configuration as this is individual.
