# Default Config explained

The default config is written as yaml. This should make it easy to make your own changes because it is written exactly as you would in your dashboard.

You can find it [here](/src/config/gridDefaultConfig.yml)

Additionally for this View Strategy the platforms options is hard-coded so it is not defined in yaml but can be overwritten!

There are Rows for:

- UniFi
- HACS
- ESPHome
- Zigbee
- Other (always present everything that is not defined in platforms!)
