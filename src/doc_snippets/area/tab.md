## Tabs

The tabs shown in the the main section.

Define as many Tabs as you want.
The Tab will only be shown in the View per Area when it has content.

Example: if the Living Room has a Tab where none of the rows would have entities (like Camera, which has only one row and can easily be empty) the whole Tab is hidden.
